Creates a powerful EMP burst that disables any core or mods under the area of influence and temporarily deactivates base defenses. 
Earther

Kinetic Shield
Shields the base and stops incoming attacks dead in their tracks. The buffer zone created by the shield disables enemy weapons temporarily.
Solar Cell
Converts solar power into usable energy and decreases the total power consumption of a base helping it avoid destabilization.
Compactor
Optimizes mod capacity on base rings and opens up more storage slots.The power requirement of any mods deployed on compactor slots is higher than normal mods.


# Fracking : Mining for resources

How do I find items near me? 

You can find resources, weapons, mods and other inventory around you using the scan button. This allows you to select from a list of items in your vicinity and find their approximate location.
Once an item is selected through the scan then four buttons will appear on the map screen. Each of these buttons corresponds to a geometric shape that confines a certain area. 
These shapes are arranged in such a way that the intersection of them gives you the coordinates of the item.
Move towards the intersection of the shapes to pick up the item.


# Crafting items

How do I craft an item? 

You can acquire resources required to craft an item through fractal mining. Resources are broadly classified into 3 types Elementals, Catalysts, and Exotics. You also need to find artifacts called ‘Blueprints’ that hold the recipe to craft these items.
Each ‘Blueprint’ is coded with a recipe that creates an artifact, You can only find out what artifact you can unlock with a ‘Blueprint’ only after you acquire it. Once the required resources are available you can craft the item by initiating the craft sequence.
What are the different resources available for crafting? 
Elementals are the base material for any kind of weapon, mod or artifact. It is commonly found and can exhibit the physical and chemical properties of any known element on earth. 
Catalysts are powerful transmuting agents capable of melding the most unlikely elements together.
Exotics are tachyon particles believed to be capable of storing predefined material blueprints. They are the powerhouse of every weapon, mod or artifact.

What are the different roles and privileges of clan members? 

All Players in a clan except the founders are sorted into Recruits, Veterans, Officers depending on their performance. Each class has its own set of privileges and players are promoted or demoted depending on player actions such as creating Base to Base connections, Planting Bases, Contributing TC to base upgrade and Inviting players to clan.

Veteran privileges: 
Class management 
Pinning messages 
Upgrading Base

What is a clan base? 

Each clan can set up its own base to defend cores of their Megacorp in the area. The base activates clan features such as clan chat. The base is powered by cores connected to it and can be fortified with mods to protect these cores.
How do I set up a clan base? 
Founders can set up a clan base by planting a base seed at the desired location. The base requires power to sustain and gets it from energy cores connected to it. It is ideal to plant a base where there is a high density of cores belonging to your Megacorp to power it.

What are mods? 

Mods are enhancements that can be equipped on base ring slots. Mods help to defend the base against enemy attack.
What is core-base connection? 
Bases need power to stay stable. This power is provided by cores that are connected to it.

What are base rings? 

Each base will have influence rings attached to them. Every time a base will level up, an influence ring will spawn around the outermost ring. If there is already a ring present, the new ring will spawn outside the current outermost ring. The maximum rings will depend on the maximum levels of the base. Each ring will have a certain number of mod slots attached to it.

What are mod slots? 

Mod slots are storage slots which are present on the influence rings of the base. These mod slots can be equipped with mods that can help defend the base.

How do I maintain a clan base? 

The clan base is powered by the cores connected to it. The power consumption of the clan base is dependent on the base level as well as the number of mods equipped on it. If the power supplied by the cores is less than the power consumption of the base then the base is destabilized and loses its base rings one by one until the power deficit is met. 

# Battling an emney cluster – 404

# Battle Maps 

What is the Battle map?

Dominance history shows the details of the strength of each Megacorp in the previous cycles.
What is the default map view? 
The map view shows all the base to base connections and the associated bases of the player’s Megacorp. The attack strings initiated by their Megacorp and incoming attack strings are also shown to the player. The information can be filtered according to zoom levels by which players can filter high-level bases from low-level bases. At the highest zoom level, the player can also view cores in their area.

What is Virtual community board? 

Trade inventory and communicate with nearby players using the Virtual Community Board. It shows you all the messages and trade requests which are within your vicinity. This board is constantly updated as you move.

Clicking on a battle (Represented as coloured lines on the log) will give the player details of the two bases involved in the battle as well as details of the battle.

What is a Battle Simulation? 

The Battle simulation view can be used by players to simulate and visualize the result of initiating attacks on other bases. This view gives the present cluster strength of the player’s faction and the enemy cluster strength after considering the base under attack. The player can view enemy bases of one Megacorp at a time using the Megacorp filters. 

How do I simulate a battle in Battle maps? 

Click on your base that you want to initiate the attack string from, then click on the enemy base (in the enemy cluster) that you want to attack. An attack link will be simulated (Represented as a dotted line) and will give you details of yours and enemy cluster strengths. The simulation will also show all of the bases involved in the battle for your cluster and the enemy cluster.

How do I interpret a Battle simulation? 

All the incoming connections from the selected base that do not add to cluster strength are marked in 
All the outgoing connections that add to cluster strength are marked in 
All the closed loops that do not add to cluster strength are marked in
